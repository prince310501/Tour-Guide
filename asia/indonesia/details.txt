indonesia  is one of the most diverse places on Earth – whether that’s in terms of people, culture, and languages or landscapes and wildlife.Lying between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, its islands’ habitats are just as diverse. While in Bali you can find beautiful beaches, Borneo has wonderful wildlife and awe-inspiring orangutans. With so much to see and do, the ‘Emerald of the Equator’ definitely warrants a visit.
