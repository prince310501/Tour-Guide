 South Africa boasts some of the best and most well-run national parks and game reserves in Africa. Home to not only the towering Drakensburg Mountains but the arid Kalahari Desert and lush Garden Route, South Africa truly is a delight to explore. To top it all off, both its Atlantic and Indian Ocean coastline are riddled with stupendous scenery and fabulous beaches.
